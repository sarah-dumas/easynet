This is a writeup for the final project. The project appears to work as
intended for all tests performed. There are a few details which may cause the
project to not work when run on a clean machine:

1. Project assumes pre-installation of all required packages.

2. Project assumes an accurate auto.home is in place and functional. I did
not include this step because my machine (itvm26-1) has an out-of-date
version of auto.home. This file changes often so the assumption is that 
someone has carried or will carry over auto.home later.

3. The hosts.config file is not complete and was simply implemented
for testing. If all blocks are filled in then the file will work as intended,
at the moment it contains routes only to itvm23-1 and will not connect to 
any other machines.
